I am a historical phonologist and occasional labphonista at the [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique](http://www.cnrs.fr/) at [IKER UMR5478](http://www.iker.cnrs.fr/?lang=en). I mainly work on the typology of sound change, with a focus on the historical changes found in [Basque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_language).

I have worked on a wide range of topics including metathesis, u-fronting, nasalized aspiration, consonant cluster resolution, accentual shifts, final obstruent voicing, and acoustic descriptions of endangered dialects. You can find most of these papers in the publications section of this website.

I currently teach [Basque Phonology](/teaching/euskalfono) at the [UPPA](https://www.univ-pau.fr/en/home.html) and [Sound Change](/teaching/soundchange) at the UPV/EHU's [Linguistics Masters](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/master/master-theoretical-experimental-linguistics).

You might remember me from my time at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) of the [University of Munich](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/index.html), the Phonetics Lab of the [University of the Basque Country](https://www.ehu.eus/eu/home), or the briefer periods I spent at the [City University of New York](https://gc.cuny.edu/Home) or the [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english/).

If my name rings a bell but my face and work don't match with it, note that there is yet another linguist that answers to A. Egurtzegi: Check out [my brother's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aitor_Egurtzegi) work on psycholinguistics at Uni Zurich.
