Modern approaches to diachronic phonology applied to Basque (MADPAB) (ANR-AAPG2020, 2021-2024)
=============

This project aims to improve our current understanding of Basque historical phonology by incorporating recent advances in theories of phonetically based sound change. We aim to combine the historical-comparative method with phonetic detail and quantitative typological data for studying the historical sound patterns of a language isolate such as Basque, in which the comparative method finds most difficulties. This project will advance our knowledge of general typologies of sound change with a thorough analysis of uncommon changes. The areas of interest cover nasalized /h~/, stops, sibilants, vowels, and the accentual system. The long-term significance of the project lies in contributing to the reconstruction of the phonology of Proto-Basque as well as to typologies of phonetically based sound change and change in situations of linguistic contact. An indirect major benefit of the project is that it will provide a new methodology for the study of the historical phonologies of isolates.


Mixean Basque
=============

This project involves the phonetic description of Mixean Low Navarrese, an endangered variety of Basque. Preceding the acoustic analysis of this variety, we compile an overview of all previous acoustic studies performed on different Basque varieties, in order to synthesize the sparse acoustic descriptions of the language that are available. This synthesis serves as a basis for the acoustic analysis performed in the current study, in which we replicate the various acoustic descriptions given in previous studies in a single, cohesive general acoustic description of Mixean Basque. The analyses include formant and duration measurements for the six-vowel system, voice onset time measurements for the three-way stop system, spectral center of gravity for the sibilants, and number of lingual contacts in the alveolar rhotic tap and trill. Important findings include: a centralized realization ([Ê‰]) of the high-front rounded vowel usually described as /y/; a data-driven confirmation of the three-way laryngeal opposition in the stop system; evidence in support of an alveolo-palatal to apical sibilant merger; and the discovery of a possible incipient merger of rhotics. These results show how using experimental acoustic methods to study under-represented linguistic varieties can result in revelations of sound patterns otherwise undescribed in more commonly studied varieties.
